      I'm David, a <i>mostly</i> self-taught programmer.
      I'm currently studying <a class="intext-link" href="#">Computer Science</a> and <a class="intext-link"
        href="#">Artificial Intelligence</a> at University.
      <br>
      My software development interests include ML/DL, web development and game development.
      <br>
      When I'm not behind the keyboard, I'm usually spending time with my <a class="intext-link" href="/blog.html#meet-the-team">two fuzzy
        friends</a>. 🐶

      I wrote my first line of code using 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7gek_yw70" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Visual Basic</a> 
      in roughly
      2012.
      Since then I have picked up languages such as C/C++, Python, Go, and C#.
      I am also familiar with frontend web development using HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap and jQuery. 😎
      <br>
      <br>
      My favourite programming language is Python, and through personal experience I have made use of
      various modules such as NumPy, PyTorch, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn for machine learning and analysis. 📊
      <br>
      <br>
      As a <i>side hobby</i> I have explored game development using the Unity3D engine,
      Godot engine, as well as language frameworks such as OpenGL, SFML, SDL2, and PyGame. 🎮
