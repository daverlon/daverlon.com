        has proven to be an extremely useful guide to learn computer vision. I have completed
        03: PyTorch Computer Vision and spent a lot of time closely examining each step and calculation 
        which PyTorch does behind the scenes. 
        <br>
        In <a href="https://github.com/davlondev/ai_notebooks/blob/main/pytorch-zero-to-hero/03_pytorch_computer_vision.ipynb" target="_blank">this notebook</a>,
        I loosely follow the guide presented on LearnPytorch, and found myself filling countless
        gaps in my knowledge about numPy and PyTorch. I challenged myself to mimic the functionality 
        hidden within PyTorch, by researching the functionality and steps behind 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" target="_blank">convolutional neural networks</a> (CNNs).
        <br>
        The explainations which were presented on LearnPyTorch were kept brief, and in some cases 
        had external resources to further explain and demonstrate the concepts. 
        <br>
        The leap from simple-but-non-linear neural networks to CNNs was the biggest leap I have experienced 
        so far (though I have only scratched the surface). The time I spent deeply examining the different 
        functionality which PyTorch was using helped too.

        I was able to match the nn.Conv2d layer, using the following code.

        There are many more <i>close examinations</i> 
        and recreations of other PyTorch functionality in the notebook. 
        Feel free to check them out!
