  <p>It's university break. <i>Sometimes I find myself more dedicated and motivated toward my studies during
    the break...</i> Anyway, I've been recently working on a longer-term personal *fun* 
    project, which is a small code-oriented game <i>framework</i> designed to build 2D games.
    The engine itself is being developed using C++, 
    <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL" target="_blank">SDL2</a>.
    I'm using SDL2 as the rendering backend of the engine, and designing the structure from scratch.
    <br>
    <br>
    A long while ago, I found myself intrigued with just how games and game engines are structed in the backend.
    I noticed that when I tried to create small games, that the classic <i>every entity in the game is an actaul
        object in the programming language.
    </i> (Heavily object oriented design) was extremely difficult to work with as the project became more and more complex.

    However, for this project, I decided to implement the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system" target="_blank">ECS architecture</a>

    into the design, and so far it has worked wonderfully for
    general project organization and I suspect for 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache" target="_blank">performance</a>
    as well..

    Moments before starting on this exact post, I pretty much finished refactoring the tilemap system which
    I had previously implemented. The reason I'm mentioning this is because I did not notice exactly how much progress 
    I had made with the engine until I thought of possibly merging the tilemap system and the ECS system (previously completely seperate).
    And with small tweaks, I made tilemaps work completely seamlessly with the entity management system, as tilemaps were now an entity with
    a tilemap component.

    The main reason for making this post is that I believe the engine is now <u>almost</u> in a state, which is ready to be
    showcased!
