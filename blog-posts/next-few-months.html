  <p>
    I have decided to take on University <i>part-time</i> for the
    rest of this semester. This will allow me to spend much more
    time learning and developing web applications to boost my
    personal portfolio. I am currently working on a full-stack application
    using <a href="https://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a>.
    Updates and progress will be posted here! I have decided to use Django 
    because I am already with Python. After exploring and deploying a Django 
    application, I plan on going <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Force" target="_blank">full-force</a> 
    with ASP.NET Core. ðŸ˜Ž

    For this website, I plan to add functionality to sort blog posts in categories.
    <br>
    Also, as posts accumulate, I will need to add a page system.
    <br>
    And finally, dark mode coming soon! ðŸŒ™
