        Exams are now over. It is time to stop studying for my University
        classes, and drastically improve my deep learning skills. I'm going
        spend much of the University break trying to go from <b>zero</b> to <b> hero</b>. ðŸ˜Ž
        <br>
        Here are some resources I am following which I would recommend!

        This spiral dataset was taken from <a href="https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/" target="_blank">CS231n</a>.
        By training a neural net with 4 layers and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)" target="_blank">ReLU</a> function,
        I was able to get pretty good results. The image below shows the accuracy over 7500 epochs of training the training set.

    <p>With further improvements and extra training, I was able to get it to around 96% accuracy on completely
        new generations of the dataset.
